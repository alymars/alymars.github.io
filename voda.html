          <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
          <p class="p-body">
            To safely and efficiently enjoy your time on the water, it is best
            to check weather conditions beyond the temperature and precipitation
            chances. You want to know wave strength, wind speed, and algae
            content. Existing weather applications are not meeting the goal of
            making complex weather data accessible and easy to understand. Often
            you have to pay for more detailed weather reports, or the language
            is too technical for the average person to comprehend.

          <h2>The Process</h2>
          <p class="p-body">
            As a former figure skater from the Midwest, I knew next to nothing
            about what kind of information was important to water sportspeople.
            So, I began by researching what types of applications already
            existed for this demographic and learned about their strengths,
            weakness, and where the opportunities were for my application to
            fill a need.

                Provide activity recommendations based on weather conditions to
                take the guesswork away from the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                Track algae blooms in water sources to keep people out of
                dangerous bodies of water that can make them sick.
              </li>
              <li>
                Offer safety suggestions so the user can know how to proceed
                beforehand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simplify and streamline the information provided and its

              <li>
                Allow the user to customize what they see to give them control

              ><b>navigation menus need to be condensed</b></mark
            >. There were several applications with expansive menus and
            submenus, which can lead to confusion about where to go for
            information. After completing my analysis of the current market and
            competitors, I began to plan for interviewing and surveying my
            target market; adults who participate in water sports.

        <p class="p-body">Early iterations of Voda included:</p>
        <div>
          <ul id="listG">
            <li>
              One information card per screen on mobile to give equal attention
              to all the information and avoid one set of information getting
              overlooked simply because it was last on the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              A pop-up window for the safety information; so that users would
              focus on the message instead of scrolling past it.
            </li>
            <li>
              A brief text overview of the weather so that if they didn't want
              to view all the visual information, they had a snapshot.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="p-body">
          During usability testing, this view was not favorable. Participants
          found the overview text redundant and would have preferred that the
          safety information was in its place instead. This layout was also
          inefficient once I added the 10-day and monthly views. So I was
          challenged to find another way to provide the necessary information
          without cluttering the screen and overwhelming the user. I looked
          through other existing applications and concepts to research different
          layout structures in order to improve my design.

          For moderated tests, I timed how long it took to complete three of the
          main tasks because the goal is for users to check the weather in three

            After completing the final iteration, I conducted a usability test
            for feedback. Participants liked the weather icons, the overall look
            of the application, and the information provided, most notably the
            algae reporting. Participants also commented on how easy the app was
            to navigate; there were no mentions of people being confused or
            frustrated by the flow. I completed a
            <mark class="orange"><b>minor update in January</b></mark> to

            because the research participants mentioned swimming the most.

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <div>
          <p class="p-body">
            This project taught me the full scope of the design process. When I
            chose to do a weather application, I assumed I know what I wanted it
            to look like and what users wanted. However, after completing the
            competior analysis, I knew I had to rethink everything. It seems
            obvious now, but weather is a complex science. Translating that
            science so that it is useful to the everyman, took a lot of work. I
            also learned why you should never rely on assumptions. For example,
            before research, I thought most would say surfing is there primary
            water sport. Although people did mention surfinng, swimming and
            kayaking were to top two responses. This completely changed the
            initial direction of my project. Learning this early in the process
            saved me from a lot of wasted time and extra work.
